        We use the finest ingredients to create each of our 100% natural
        hand-crafted beers. Sit back and relax in our comfortable tasting room.
        We have an assortment of snacks (chips, nuts, and jerky) available to

      <p className="about-text">
        It all started with a passion for home brewing! Our family and friends
        really enjoyed the beers that we were creating. We entered a few home
        brew competitions with our beers placing first, second, and third in
        various beer styles. And here we are today with a 7 bbl system brewery &
        tasting room in beautiful Rancho Cucamonga! We look forward to sharing
        our flavorful hand-crafted beers with you. Hope to serve you soon.
        Cheers!
